Hi, I’m Sam 👋

I’m a founder working in the automation and go-to-market space.

Over the last few years, I’ve built and operated early-stage products, then worked inside high-growth data teams. Across both, I kept running into the same problem: teams invest in powerful tools, but struggle to understand how their workflows actually fit together — or what they could automate next.

Previously:
- Founded **Aiva**, an AI-powered email and workflow assistant, and grew early traction through outbound and customer discovery
- Ran **Surge**, a bootstrapped marketing agency I started at 19 and scaled to ~£4k MRR during COVID
- Worked in GTM at **Databricks**, building internal automation workflows and supporting data & AI use cases with fast-growing companies

Now:
- Building tools around workflow discovery and automation
- Experimenting with no-code, AI-assisted systems, and fast iteration
- Talking to operators about how their teams really work

I’m interested in reducing busywork, speeding up execution, and designing systems that actually fit human behaviour.
